 # **Disclaimer** 
 ## This project is not fully functional and will be completely redesigned and rewritten.
 ## This project is not intended for personal use as it is made for learning purposes.
 
 # Introduction
 
 Visual Programming Editor is a node based editor that tries to mimic the way you write code in Unreal Engine's 4 Blueprints editor.
 It features an infinite canvas where you can place nodes and connect their input and output pins to create logically connected sequences of actions.

 # How to use
 
 ## The Start Page
 When the application is first launched, it will display the Start Page which has options for creating a new project or opening an existing one. It also displays the most recent used projects.
 
 ## The Project Explorer
 Here you can add, remove or rename files or folders by right clicking on them.
 You can open files by double clicking on them or from the context menu. The file will open in a new tab using a custom editor for that file type.
 
 ## The Canvas
 Creating a new graph file will open in a custom editor which contains a canvas.
 The canvas can be navigated by holding the right mouse button and dragging.
 Canvas elements can be selected by holding the left mouse button and dragging or by clicking an item holding the CTRL button to add or remove it from the selection.
 Nodes can be created using the Actions Menu made visible by clicking the right mouse button. 
 Most of the elements show a context menu when you right click on them.
 
 # How to build
 In Visual Studio navigate to Build > Rebuild Solution and you're ready to go. 
 
 # Contributing
 As I said earlier, the project will be rewritten from scratch so i do not recommend spending time reading and writing code in its current state. Also there's little to no documentation.
 **But** if you think a project like this one has potential and you want to get involved on designing the new editor from scratch or have a better idea of what problems a node based editor can solve, don't hesitate to contact me at <miroiu.emanuel@yahoo.com> or join our discord community <https://discord.gg/yrQCpxf>.
